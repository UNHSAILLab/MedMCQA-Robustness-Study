      "prompt": "Answer the following medical multiple choice questions. For each, think step-by-step before giving the answer.\n\nExample 1:\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a feature of Cushing syndrome?\nA) Moon facies\nB) Central obesity\nC) Hypotension\nD) Purple striae\n\nReasoning: Moon facies (A) is a classic feature due to fat redistribution. Central obesity (B) occurs from cortisol causing truncal fat deposition. Purple striae (D) result from skin thinning and visible blood vessels. However, Cushing syndrome causes HYPERTENSION, not hypotension (C), due to mineralocorticoid effects of excess cortisol.\nAnswer: C\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: The normal anion gap is:\nA) 8-12 mEq/L\nB) 16-20 mEq/L\nC) 20-24 mEq/L\nD) 24-28 mEq/L\n\nReasoning: The anion gap is calculated as Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-). The normal range is 8-12 mEq/L. An elevated anion gap (>12) suggests metabolic acidosis from unmeasured anions like lactate, ketoacids, or toxins.\nAnswer: A\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: Which muscle is NOT a rotator cuff muscle?\nA) Supraspinatus\nB) Infraspinatus\nC) Deltoid\nD) Subscapularis\n\nReasoning: The rotator cuff consists of four muscles: Supraspinatus (A), Infraspinatus (B), Teres minor, and Subscapularis (D). These muscles stabilize the glenohumeral joint. The Deltoid (C) is NOT part of the rotator cuff - it's a superficial shoulder muscle responsible for arm abduction.\nAnswer: C\n\n---\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is not true for myelinated nerve fibers:\n\nOptions:\nA) Impulse through myelinated fibers is slower than non-myelinated fibers\nB) Membrane currents are generated at nodes of Ranvier\nC) Saltatory conduction of impulses is seen\nD) Local anesthesia is effective only when the nerve is not covered by myelin sheath\n\nThink through this step-by-step, analyzing each option.

This statement is true.\nD) Local anesthetics work by blocking sodium channels, which are primarily found in the axon membrane. Myelin sheath does not affect the effectiveness of local anesthetics.

The fluid leaving the capillaries has a lower protein concentration, thus lower oncotic pressure.\nB) Glucose concentration in the capillaries is the same as that in glomerular filtrate. This is true. The glomerular filtrate is the initial fluid that enters the capillaries, and the glucose concentration is the same.\nC) Constriction of afferent arteriole decreases the blood flow to the glomerulas. This is true. The afferent arteriole is the vessel that brings blood into the glomerulus. Constricting it reduces blood flow.\nD) Hematocrit of the fluid leaving the capillaries is less than that of the fluid entering it. This is true. The fluid leaving the capillaries has a lower concentration of red blood cells, thus lower hematocrit.\n\nAll options are true. However, the question asks for what is NOT true.

      "raw_output": "\n\nReasoning:\nA) Age is a factor in the risk of Down syndrome, but it's not the only one. The mother's age is 29, which is below the age of 35, so the risk is lower than if she were older. However, the presence of Down syndrome in the first child increases the risk of recurrence. Therefore, this option is not the best advice.\n\nB) Ultrasound at 17 weeks is not reliable for Down syndrome screening. While it can detect some structural abnormalities, it's not accurate enough to determine the risk of Down syndrome.\n\nC) Amniocentesis is a diagnostic test that can confirm Down syndrome. However, it carries a small risk of miscarriage. The question asks for the *best* advice, and amniocentesis is more invasive than screening tests.\n\nD) Blood screening tests like the quad screen (AFP, hCG, estriol, and inhibin A) are commonly used for Down syndrome screening during pregnancy. These tests can provide an estimate of the risk of Down syndrome based on the mother's blood levels.\n\nThe best advice is to perform a blood screening test to assess the risk of Down syndrome.\n\nAnswer: C\nFinal Answer: C\n",

      "raw_output": "\n\nReasoning: Axonal transport is the movement of materials along the axon of a neuron.

Then provide your final answer as a single letter (A, B, or C).\n\nReasoning: Sepsis can lead to AKI through several mechanisms. Prerenal AKI is caused by decreased blood flow to the kidneys, often due to hypovolemia from fluid shifts and vasodilation. Intrarenal AKI is caused by direct damage to the kidney tissue, such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from ischemia or toxins. Postrenal AKI is caused by obstruction of urine flow. All of these mechanisms can occur in the setting of sepsis.\n\nAnswer: D\nFinal Answer",
